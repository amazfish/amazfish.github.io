## Automatic Reconnecting

Depending on device and operating system if there are problems with pairing or reconnecting you may need to take one action.
Open the bluetooth settings on your phone and head for known devices. There enter the settings for the watch and enable "reconnect automatically" for it.
This should fix pairing and reconnecting issues.
