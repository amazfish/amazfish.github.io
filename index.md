## Supported Devices

There are 3 tiers of supported devices:
* Gold - These are devices I have, have tested, and will try not to break any functionality.
* Silver - These are devices which are properly implemented in the application, but I do not have and are tested by the community
* Bronze - These are devices which use a protocol that is close to another supported device, and so is treated like that device.  Your mileage may vary with these devices.
 
## Powered by KEXI

As of version 0.5.1, activity data is retrieved into an SQLite database.  Because I think it is important to allow individuals to be in control of their own data, and that
they should have the ability to analyze it themselves, I have chosen to store data in a KEXI compatible database.  This will allow you to copy the database from the phone,
and open it up inside KEXI on Linux/Windows/Mac and perform queries and reports on it.  This added ability means I link to a couple of KDE libraries, which should be
installed automatically.
